# University Homework - Odev01

This repository contains three Jupyter Notebook files (odev01.ipynb, odev01_extra.ipynb, and odev01_extra_advanced.ipynb) for the begining of a programming course in a university. The files contains some simple codes  for the assigments.

 *odev01.ipynb*

This file contains the main homework assignment. It has 5 python questions and their answers.


*odev01_extra.ipynb*
This file contains an extra homework assignment for those who are familiar with the basics. It adds functionality to the main program by allowing the user to enter the student's department and student number, and print this information.

# *odev01_extra_advanced.ipynb*

This file is an advanced and shorter version of the odev01_extra.ipynb file.
It includes all the functionality of the extra homework assignment in a more concise and efficient way and 
also  saves the data to a CSV file (ogrenciler.csv). If the CSV file already exists, the program appends the data to the end of the file.
